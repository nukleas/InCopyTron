InCopyTron
==========

InCopyTron is a tool set for InCopy and InDesign that helps analyze and improve articles. Integrates with vjoon K4.

## Purpose

InCopyTron is a tool to analyze stories and articles in InCopy/InDesign and assist production editors working in publications.

InCopyTron started as a small set of scripts that automated some aspects of error-checking and editing, including finding quotes to pull out or extracting hyperlinks from the article. It also works with vjoon K4 to view metadata, and seemingly on the web, few InCopy scripts seem to do.

##Use

Extract into a directory and run the main InCopyTron.js file within InCopy or InDesign. The program, because it is written in JavaScript, should be able to run on Mac versions of IC/ID, however that has not yet been tested.
